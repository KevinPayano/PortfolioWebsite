                <p class="font-light font-sans sm:text-xl text-gray-400">I noticed that most of the competitors sites have reviews from clients about a job well done they did on their property. However, I put myself in the shoes of a new client and asked myself, "Can I see the job they done for that client?"</p>
                <br>
                <p class="font-light font-sans sm:text-xl text-gray-400">So I decided to build an image review slideshow showing potential clients both the review and the project that was done.</p>
